# Exercise 59-4

Write a network server that stores name-value pairs. The server should allow names
to be added, deleted, modified, and retrieved by clients. Write one or more client
programs to test the server. Optionally, implement some kind of security mechanism
to allow only the client that created the name to delete it or to modify the value
associated with it.
