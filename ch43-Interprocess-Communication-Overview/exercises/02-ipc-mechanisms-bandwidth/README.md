# Exercise 43.2

Repeat the preceding exercise for System V message queues, POSIX message queues, UNIX domain
strema sockets, and UNIX domain datagram sockets. Use these programs to compare the relative
performance of the various IPC facilities on Linux. If you have access to other UNIX implementations,
perform the same comparisons on those systems.
