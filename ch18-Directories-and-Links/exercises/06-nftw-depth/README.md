# Exercise 18.6

Modify the program in Listing 18-3 (`nftw_dir_tree.c`) to use the `FTW_DEPTH` flag. Note
the difference in the order in which the directory tree is traversed.

## Solution

Actually, the `FTW_DEPTH` flag is already available in the listing via the `-d` option, so no change
is necessary.
